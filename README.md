# StyleGAN of All Trades: Image Manipulation withOnly Pretrained StyleGAN
![](teaser.pdf)

This is the PyTorch implementation of [StyleGAN of All Trades: Image Manipulation withOnly Pretrained StyleGAN](). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mchong6/SOAT/blob/main/infinity.ipynb)


>**Abstract:**<br>
Recently, StyleGAN has enabled various image manipulation and editing tasks thanks to the high-quality generation and the disentangled latent space. However, additional architectures or task-specific training paradigms are usually required for different tasks. In this work, we take a deeper look at the spatial properties of StyleGAN. We show that with a pretrained StyleGAN along with some operations, without any additional architecture, we can perform comparably to the state-of-the-art methods on various tasks, including image blending, panorama generation, generation from a single image, controllable and local multimodal image to image translation, and attributes transfer.
